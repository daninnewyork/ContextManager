if we create a child context once per user event, the stacks will be correct but the cache will increase forever

if we create a single child context, the cache will clear but the stacks will be missing the event context on subsequent events

stacks seem wrong now that children and getCurrentContext aren't clones -- we seem to be repeating stacks somewhere
